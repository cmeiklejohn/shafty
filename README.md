# shafty

ClojureScript functional reactive programming library.

## Disclaimer

Shafty is currently under development and the API is subject to change.

Shafty shouldn't be used in production.

Get in touch if you are interested in helping out.

## Usage

### Events

Events represent time-varying functions which have a finite set of
occurences over time.

### Behaviours

Behaviours are time-varying functions which constantly have a value.
Derive a behaviour from an event, or generate a receiver to watch a
particular DOM element, such as an input field.

## Incomplete

* Switching.
* Clean up repetition in shafty.event.

## Examples

### Elapsed Timer

```clojure
(defn- timer []
  "Generate a timer, and convert the timer into a behaviour."
  (-> (timer! 1000 (fn [] (js/Date.)))
      (map! (fn [x] (.log js/console "Timer ticked.") x))
      (hold! (js/Date.))))

(defn- reset [timer]
  "Generate a behaviour originating from click events on the reset
  button.  When clicked, snapshot the current state of the timer."
  (-> (event! (dom/getElement "reset-button") "click")
      (snapshot! timer)
      (map! (fn [x] (.log js/console "Reset button clicked.") x))
      (hold! (js/Date.))))

(defn main []
  "Run the elapsed time example."

  (let [the-timer (timer)
        reset-button (reset the-timer)]
    (-> (lift2! the-timer reset-button (fn [now click] (- now click)) 0)
        (insert! (dom/getElement "elapsed"))))

  (.log js/console "Starting the elapsed time example."))
```

### Autosave

```clojure
(defn- build-request [value]
  "Generate a request object."
  { :url "/save" :data { :value value } :method "post" })

(defn- live-content []
  "Generate a behaviour for the live content area."
  (behaviour! (dom/getElement "live-content") nil))

(defn- timer []
  "Generate a timer."
  (-> (timer! 10000 (fn [] (js/Date.)))
      (map! (fn [x] (.log js/console "Timer ticked.") x))))

(defn main []
  "Run the autosave example."

  (-> (event! (dom/getElement "save-button") "click")
      (map! (fn [x] (.log js/console "Button clicked.") x))
      (merge! (timer))
      (snapshot! (live-content))
      (map! build-request)
      (requests!))

  (.log js/console "Starting the autosave example."))
```

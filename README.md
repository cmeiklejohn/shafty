# shafty

ClojureScript functional reactive programming library.

## Disclaimer

Shafty is currently under development and the API is subject to change.

Get in touch if you are interested in helping out.

## Usage

### Events

Events represent time-varying functions which have a finite set of
occurences over time.

### Behaviours

Behaviours are time-varying functions which constantly have a value.
Derive a behaviour from an event, or generate a receiver to watch a
particular DOM element, such as an input field.

## Incomplete

* Functionality to add:
  * switch!.
  * ~~send! for streams, remove explicit -notify-watches.~~
* Explore:
  * ~~Topological propagation.~~
  * ~~Delayed value propagation and queueing of events.~~
  * ~~Adding a sentinal value instead of explicit propagate! calls.~~
  * ~~Event constructors taking sources.~~
  * ~~Function to add sinks instead of direct set! command.~~
  * ~~Change order of arugments to core functions?~~
  * ~~Time stepping.~~
